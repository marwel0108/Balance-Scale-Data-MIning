# **Seeds Data Set Analysis.**

## **Project's description.**
This project is the foundation of data mining, it applies statistical analysis on data to know if it is a good data set to work with and to decide whether it would be a nice model for developing a classificator.

### _**All you need to know.**_
The description of the dataset and all the processes applied to it can be read inside the [**notebook**](notebook.ipynb).
